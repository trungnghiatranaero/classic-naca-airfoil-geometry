Numerical reconstruction and geometric analysis of classic NACA airfoil profiles using analytical formulations.
# Classic NACA Airfoil Geometry and Numerical Modeling

## Overview
This project presents an analytical introduction to classic NACA airfoil series, 
focusing on geometric formulation and numerical modeling of airfoil profiles.

The objective is to reconstruct airfoil shapes using mathematical expressions 
and investigate geometric characteristics such as camber line and thickness distribution.

## Contents
- Historical background of NACA airfoils
- Mathematical formulation of 4-digit series
- Numerical implementation in Excel
- Geometric analysis and observations

## Methodology
- Analytical derivation of camber line
- Thickness distribution equation implementation
- Coordinate generation along chord
- Graphical visualization and parameter variation study

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel (numerical modeling)
- LaTeX (technical documentation)

## Key Observations
- Influence of maximum camber on airfoil curvature
- Effect of thickness ratio on profile geometry
- Symmetric vs cambered airfoil comparison

## Conclusion
The study highlights the geometric foundation of classical NACA profiles 
and demonstrates how mathematical modeling enables airfoil reconstruction 
without advanced CFD tools.
